                <h2>Welcome to Kazakhstan!</h2>
                <p><strong>Republic of Kazakhstan</strong>,is a country located mainly in Central Asia.Kazakhstan&apos;s terrain extends west to east from the Caspian Sea to the Altay Mountains and north to south from the plains of Western Siberia to the oases and deserts of Central Asia. The Kazakh Steppe, with an area of around 804,500 square kilometres, occupies one-third of the country and is the world&apos;s largest dry steppe region. The steppe is characterised by large areas of grasslands and sandy regions. Major seas, lakes and rivers include Lake Balkhash, Lake Zaysan, the Charyn River and gorge, the Ili, Irtysh, Ishim, Ural and Syr Darya rivers, and the Aral Sea until it largely dried up in one of the world&apos;s worst environmental disasters.</p>

                    <p class="text"><abbr title=" the Republic of Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</abbr> is the <em>ninth-largest country</em> by area and the largest landlocked country.In 2017, Kazakhstan ranked 43rd in the world in terms of number of tourist arrivals. <br><br>In 2000 total 1.47 million international tourists visited Kazakhstan, which was increased to 4.81 million in 2012.Kazakhstan&apos;s great mineral resources and arable lands have long aroused the envy of outsiders, and the resulting exploitation has generated environmental and political problems. The forced settlement of the nomadic Kazakhs in the Soviet period, combined with large-scale Slavic in-migration, strikingly altered the Kazakh way of life and led to considerable settlement and urbanization in Kazakhstan.The Kazakhs&apos; traditional customs uneasily coexist alongside incursions of the modern world.</p>
